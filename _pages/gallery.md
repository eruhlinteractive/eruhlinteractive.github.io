    title="Chicken Chaser"
    about="Chicken Chaser is a game I made from scratch as part of a foundations of graphics programming course during college. The game was built from scratch in C++ using a custom DirectX 11 rendering engine with support for PBR materials, and the [React3D Physics engine](https://www.reactphysics3d.com/). This project was especially helpful to learn how low-level 3D rendering and lighting systems work, as well as challenging my C++ programming skills. <br><br>**Roles:** Sole Developer <br><br>[Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAfopfmwcZw)"

    title-id="anch-tracker"
    title="Animal Crossing Creature Tracker"
    about="This project was developed for an interactive media development course that allows users to track the creatures they've caught in the game Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I am a huge fan of the Animal Crossing series, so a web utility application in vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript seemed like a great fit. <br><br>**Roles:** Sole Developer <br><br>[Visit Site](https://people.rit.edu/epr4296/330/project2/app.html)"

    title="Cat Golf"
    about="Cat Golf was also developed for an interactive media development course, using a custom game framework written in JavaScript in addition to [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) and [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) for physics and audio respectively. This project was a great challenge to test my knowledge of game engine architecture and scene management systems. The core systems were built to support JSON-based scene management and shared assets between sprites. <br><br>**Roles:** Sole Developer <br><br>[Play Online](https://people.rit.edu/epr4296/330/project3/app.html)"

    title="Office Chair Racer"
    about="Office Chair Racer is a racing game prototype I made in the Godot Game engine. The challenge of this project was developing the racer AI, as my goal was to create a challenging racer that doesn't feel unfair. As a result of this, the computer racers take in information about the curvature of the track and process it in realtime to figure out which way to turn.<br><br>**Roles:** Sole Developer <br><br>[Visit Page](https://eruhlinteractive.itch.io/office-chair-racer)"
