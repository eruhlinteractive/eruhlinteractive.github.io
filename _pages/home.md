# Hey there, I'm Ethan!

![image-left](/assets/images/portrait.jpeg){:.align-right style="clip-path:circle(50% at 144px 144px); margin-left:100px;"}

I'm a passionate programmer and game developer with multiple years of experience in C# and C++. I have worked in Unity3D and Godot for many years in addition to other engines and toolsets.

I love learning new skills and growing as a developer. Although coding is where I am most comfortable, I also have experience working with animations, asset production, and audio design.
