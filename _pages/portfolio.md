# What I Bring to the Table
Over the years I have worked on projects in multiple different roles, resulting in a strong working knowledge of many core responsibilities in game development. In every new project I take on, I am looking to apply my previous knowledge to make my new work the best that it can be! This experience also allows me to better communicate with individuals in other areas of game development.

That being said, my main focus (and what I studied to do :wink:) has always been within engineering and development roles. I have multiple years of experience in languages such as C#, C++, and Python in addition to many industry-standard tools like Unity3D, Visual Studio, and GIT to name a few. Beyond these, I am always experimenting with different tools and languages, allowing me to quickly learn and utilize new tools and workflows!

# What I'm Looking For
Being a recent graduate of a game development program, my main focus for my job search is finding a position that fosters a learning environment with other passionate individuals. There is *so* much I want to learn about game development, and I believe the best way to do that is with other awesome people who love their craft.

# My Previous Work
I have worked on a *lot* of projects professionally and personally over the past decade. Here are some of my favorites!

    this project started as a game jam game titled [Untitled Space Game](https://eruhlinteractive.itch.io/untitled-space-game).

    about="Grill Daddy is another game jam project I worked on with some friends over the course of the weekend for the [2022 ROC Game Dev Summer game jam](https://rocgamedev.com/). This game was an awesome experience to make, and it was a great test of my programming abilities.

    title="Chicken Chaser"
    about="Chicken Chaser is a game I made from scratch as part of a foundations of graphics programming course during college. The game was built from scratch in C++ using a custom DirectX 11 rendering engine with support for PBR materials, and the [React3D Physics engine](https://www.reactphysics3d.com/). This project was especially helpful to learn how low-level 3D rendering and lighting systems work, as well as challenging my C++ programming skills. <br><br>**Roles:** Sole Developer <br><br>[Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAfopfmwcZw)"

    title="Animal Crossing Creature Tracker"
    about="This project was developed for an interactive media development course that allows users to track the creatures they've caught in the game Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I am a huge fan of the Animal Crossing series, so a web utility application in vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript seemed like a great fit. <br><br>**Roles:** Sole Developer <br><br>[Visit Site](https://people.rit.edu/epr4296/330/project2/app.html)"
